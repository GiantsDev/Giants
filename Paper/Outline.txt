📖 Giants Math Framework: Clean Deliverable Integration Outline
Goal: We need an outline that holds structure while allowing us to cleanly append new deliverables without losing track of where things belong.

📌 A. Core Structure for Deliverables
Every deliverable must be clearly categorized into the outline.
Each section has a placeholder for adding deliverables.
Deliverables are attached as self-contained modules—meaning they should fit neatly into predefined slots.
Each deliverable includes:
📌 Outline Section: Where it belongs in the overall structure.
📝 Deliverable Type: Math derivation, theoretical explanation, empirical validation, computational proof.
✅ Integration Steps: A simple guide to attach it to the existing structure.
📌 B. Revised Dynamic Outline (With Deliverable Slots)
💡 Each main section has clear placeholders for appending deliverables. When we create something new, we insert it into the right slot without breaking structure.

📌 C. How This Fixes the Drift Issue
Every new deliverable is assigned a specific slot immediately upon creation.
If a section is “full,” we open a “New Slot” in the correct category.
Versioning is embedded in a way that doesn’t require constant rework.
Each deliverable is modular—meaning it doesn’t have to be integrated linearly.
Future work is always marked, ensuring that unfinished threads are captured.
📌 D. Next Steps: Immediate Integration
🔹 Let’s confirm a priority order for adding deliverables.

I recommend starting with Finalized Mathematical Framework: Alignment at the Edge of Refinement (📌 Section 2 & 4).
We then add Quadratic Convergence & Refinement Stability (📌 Section 5).
🔹 Does this revised framework work? 🚀
We can now cleanly slot in each deliverable as we go while keeping everything structured.
