# Event Horizon Magic Bean

## Overview
The **Event Horizon Magic Bean** is a conceptual and computational tool that applies the **Proof by Elimination: Universe as an Event Horizon** framework to any field of study or practice. It helps identify the boundary between **White-Hole-like (WH-like) state generation** (emergence, novelty, expansion) and **Black-Hole-like (BH-like) state loss** (irreversibility, entropy, collapse), revealing key insights into how systems evolve and stabilize.

## Features
- **Field-Specific Analysis:** Prompts users to input a field of study and maps it to known event horizon parallels.
- **Predefined Knowledge Base:** Includes structured mappings for fields such as AI, Economics, Biology, and more.
- **New Field Identification:** If an input field is not predefined, the Bean suggests **how to search** for relevant event horizon boundaries.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration:** Encourages linking concepts between thermodynamics, game theory, complexity science, and other foundational domains.
- **Dynamic Refinement:** Users can continuously expand and refine the knowledge base to improve event horizon mappings.

   ```
4. Follow the prompts to explore event horizon insights for your chosen field.

## Example Usage
```
üî∑ Welcome to the Event Horizon Magic Bean! üî∑
This tool applies the Proof by Elimination framework to any field, identifying its event horizon between new state generation and irreversible state loss.

Enter a field of study or practice: game theory in economics
‚ö° The event horizon equivalent for game theory in economics may not be well-defined yet!
üîç Suggested Search Approach:
- Look for studies that bridge 'emergent new states' and 'irreversible state loss' in this field.
- Investigate interdisciplinary links with thermodynamics, information theory, or systems science.
- Search for any prior attempts to define 'event horizon' behavior in this domain.
üöÄ Next Steps: Apply the event horizon model to see how refinement, scaling, and knowledge transition work in your field!
```

## Contributing
- To expand the list of predefined fields, modify the `known_fields` dictionary in `event_horizon_magic_bean.py`.
- If you discover a new event horizon mapping, document it in `EventHorizonMappings.md` in the same directory.
- For structured improvements, submit pull requests to the Giants repository on GitHub.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automated Search Integration:** Implement AI-assisted research suggestions for unknown fields.
- **Mathematical Formalization:** Develop equations modeling event horizon boundaries in complex systems.
- **Visualization Tools:** Generate probability field graphs for event horizon transitions in various domains.

## Credits
Developed as part of the **Giants Framework**, integrating **continuous refinement, AI oversight, and interdisciplinary discovery**.
