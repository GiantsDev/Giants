\section{Continuous Refinement Model for AGI}
The core equation of the Giants framework, illustrating the calculus-based refinement of AGI, is given by:

\begin{equation}
AGI = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \sum \left( \frac{d}{dt} \left( P_D + P_S - L(T) \right) \right) dt
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P_D$ represents the probability of insight from primary data,
    \item $P_S$ represents the probability of insight from synthetic data,
    \item $L(T)$ is the loss function over time,
    \item $\frac{d}{dt}$ captures the continuous refinement of intelligence over time.
\end{itemize}

This equation expresses the dynamic nature of AGI, emphasizing how intelligence is iteratively improved through continuous updates based on new data and refined loss functions.

\section{Recurrence Relation and Confidence Refinement}
The model’s state evolves iteratively according to the following recurrence relation:

\begin{equation}
M_{n+1} = D_{n+1} - L_{*} - L_{n+1} + M_{n}
\end{equation}

where $M_n$ represents the system state at iteration $n$, $D_{n+1}$ is new data, $L_{n+1}$ is known loss, and $L_*$ is an emergent loss term that adapts based on the system’s previous behavior.

Confidence tracking is incorporated using:

\begin{equation}
S_{\text{equation}} = e^{- \Delta \alpha}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta$ represents the mismatch between expected and actual model updates, and $\alpha$ controls the sensitivity to errors.

A unified confidence score balances equation-based confidence with holistic feedback:

\begin{equation}
S_{\text{unified}} = \beta e^{- \Delta \alpha} + \text{holistic} \left(1 - \beta\right)
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ tunes the balance between error-based confidence and holistic assessment.

\section{Statistical Power and Causal Inference}
Another crucial equation in the Giants framework relates to statistical power, defined as:

\begin{equation}
P_{\text{power}} = \frac{\int_{H_1} f(x)dx}{\int_{H_0} f(x)dx}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_1$ is the distribution under the alternative hypothesis,
    \item $H_0$ is the distribution under the null hypothesis,
    \item $f(x)$ represents the probability density function of the observed data.
\end{itemize}

This equation formalizes how we evaluate whether an observed effect is statistically meaningful, crucial for quantizing causation within the Giants model.

\section{Entropy Minimization in AGI Refinement}
To ensure long-term stability and efficiency, the framework must account for entropy minimization. We define an entropy-based intelligence refinement equation as:

\begin{equation}
S = -\sum p_i \log p_i
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ represents the entropy of the system,
    \item $p_i$ is the probability distribution of observed states in intelligence refinement.
\end{itemize}

Minimizing $S$ ensures that intelligence evolution does not devolve into randomness but maintains structured, directed improvement.

\section{Bayesian Confidence Updates for Decision-Making}
To model real-world decision-making under uncertainty, Bayesian confidence updates are incorporated:

\begin{equation}
P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) P(H)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(H|D)$ is the posterior probability given data $D$,
    \item $P(D|H)$ is the likelihood of observing $D$ under hypothesis $H$,
    \item $P(H)$ is the prior probability,
    \item $P(D)$ is the marginal likelihood.
\end{itemize}

This allows AGI models to dynamically adjust their confidence in hypotheses as new data arrives, ensuring adaptive intelligence refinement.

\section{Time-Weighted Causal Inference}
Historical data may have varying relevance over time. To account for this, we introduce a time-weighted causal inference model:

\begin{equation}
C_t = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} w(t) \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left( P_D + P_S - L(T) \right) dt
\end{equation}

where $w(t)$ is a time-weighting function that prioritizes more recent, higher-confidence observations while discounting older, less relevant data.

This ensures AGI models remain sensitive to evolving patterns without being overly influenced by outdated correlations.
