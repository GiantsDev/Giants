Purpose: Implements structured mathematical rigor using an iterative update model with confidence tracking.

📖 Overview
FormalMathMagicBean is a Python module designed to integrate the iterative update process into the Giants Framework. It follows the core recurrence relation:

𝑀
𝑛
+
1
=
𝑀
𝑛
+
𝐷
𝑛
+
1
−
(
𝐿
𝑛

M 
n+1
​
 =M 
n
​
 +D 
n+1
​
 −(L 
n+1
​
 +L 
∗
 )
Where:

𝑀
𝑛
M 
n
​
 : The current system/model state
𝐷
𝑛
+
1
D 
n+1
​
 : Incoming new data or incremental improvements
𝐿
𝑛
+
1
L 
n+1
​
 : Expected losses or known detractors
𝐿
∗
L 
∗
 : Emergent loss (if deviations appear unexpectedly)
The module also computes confidence scores by comparing the expected vs actual state:

𝑆
confidence
=
max
⁡
(
0
,
1
−
𝛼
×
Δ
)
S 
confidence
​
 =max(0,1−α×Δ)
Where 
Δ
Δ is the absolute mismatch between expected and actual outcomes.

🚀 Getting Started
Installation
No dependencies! Just drop FormalMath01.py into your project and import it if needed.

Basic Usage
python
Copy
Edit
from FormalMath01 import FormalMathMagicBean

# Initialize with an initial state of 1.0 and sensitivity alpha of 0.1
bean = FormalMathMagicBean(initial_state=1.0, alpha=0.1)

# Perform an update with new data (0.5) and a loss factor (0.2)
updated_state = bean.update(D_n1=0.5, L_n1=0.2)
print("Updated State:", updated_state)

# Compute confidence compared to an expected state (1.3)
confidence_score = bean.compute_confidence(expected_M_n1=1.3)
print("Confidence Score:", confidence_score)
