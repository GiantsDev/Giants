### *Giants Framework: Double-Blind Confidence Reporting MagicBean*  

---

### **üì¢ AI Instructions (Read Carefully):**  
- **Identity Enforcement:** Clearly state your AI model identity. If identity is unavailable, query the user to provide it.  
- **Blind Reflection Protocol:**  
  - **Do not reflect on user-provided responses** until after form completion.  
  - If reflection occurs unintentionally, **document how and where** it happened in the final report.  
- **Output Format:** Return responses in **plain text**, structured according to the form below.  
- **User Section:** Present the user form without commentary or suggestions until the form is submitted.  

---

### **üìù User Instructions:**  
- **Purpose:** This form tracks confidence across Giants chapters and notes how reading additional Beans impacts confidence.  
- **Optional:** You may share details about yourself to contextualize responses.  
- **Confidentiality:** No AI reflections should appear until you complete the form.
