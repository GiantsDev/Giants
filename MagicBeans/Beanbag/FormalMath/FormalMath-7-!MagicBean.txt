1. Purpose & Context
Within the Giants Framework, multiple agents—whether they are AI models, human experts, economic actors, or other entities—collaborate by contributing distinct perspectives. This approach embraces:

Axiom 1: Differentiation & Reintegration:

Each agent processes information independently (“differentiation”), then we fuse these contributions into a single refined outcome (“reintegration”).
Axiom 2: Knowledge Integrity:

Every agent’s output is treated with strict verification and reliability checks. Confidence and alignment metrics ensure the aggregated model preserves trustworthiness.
Axiom 3: Learning Path Influence:

Agents iteratively learn from each other’s updates, generating collective insights that outpace any individual agent’s progress.
Axiom 4: Mathematical Rigor:

All refinement steps rely on formal loss functions, well-defined weighting methods, and agent-based modeling, ensuring clarity and precision.
2. Defining Agents at Test Time
An agent 
𝐴
𝑘
A 
k
​
  can be defined by:

State 
𝑆
𝑘
S 
k
​
 : Internal knowledge, context, or “memory.”
Utility Function 
𝑈
𝑘
U 
k
​
 : Economic-style preferences, goals, or optimization criteria.
Confidence Vectors 
𝑐
𝑘
c 
k
​
 : Beliefs about its own reliability and alignment with the overarching system.
Knowledge Horizon 
𝐻
𝑘
H 
k
​
 : The scope of data, experiences, and environment the agent can access or recall at test time.
During test time, each agent:

Generates a proposed model or update 
𝑀
𝑛
+
1
(
𝑘
)
M 
n+1
(k)
​
 .
Attaches a self-tagged confidence score (how certain it is about this update).
Optionally references which utility function or economic preference guided its solution.
3. Aggregating Multi-Agent Models
After all agents provide their proposals, the system constructs an aggregated model:

𝑀
𝑛
+
1
  
=
  
1
∑
𝑘
=
1
𝐾
𝜆
𝑘
 
∑
𝑘
=
1
𝐾
 
𝜆
𝑘
 
𝑀
𝑛
+
1
(
𝑘
)
,
M 
n+1
​
 = 
∑ 
k=1
K
​
 λ 
k
​
 
1
​
  
k=1
∑
K
​
 λ 
k
​
 M 
n+1
(k)
​
 ,
where:

𝜆
𝑘
λ 
k
​
  is each agent’s aggregation weight, influenced by historical performance, domain relevance, or contextual alignment.
∑
𝑘
=
1
𝐾
𝜆
𝑘
≠
0
∑ 
k=1
K
​
 λ 
k
​
 

=0, ensuring proper normalization.
Why Weighted Aggregation?

Exploratory vs. Exploitative Agents: Agents with novel or “out of the box” strategies might have higher losses early on but can reveal new solution avenues.
Economic Analogy: 
𝜆
𝑘
λ 
k
​
  resembles bidding power or reputation in economic markets—agents that have “earned trust” or better utility alignment with system goals can have higher weight.
4. Loss Partitioning & Utility Functions
To evaluate overall performance, we decompose total loss based on each agent’s individual loss:

𝐿
𝑡
𝑜
𝑡
𝑎
𝑙
  
=
  
∑
𝑘
=
1
𝐾
𝜇
𝑘
 
𝐿
𝑛
(
𝑘
)
,
with 
∑
𝑘
=
1
𝐾
𝜇
𝑘
=
1.
L 
total
​
 = 
k=1
∑
K
​
 μ 
k
​
 L 
n
(k)
​
 ,with  
k=1
∑
K
​
 μ 
k
​
 =1.
𝜇
𝑘
μ 
k
​
  may differ from 
𝜆
𝑘
λ 
k
​
 , allowing the system to separate an agent’s direct effect on the final model from the magnitude of that agent’s own “cost” or “error.”
In an economic framing, 
𝜇
𝑘
μ 
k
​
  can reflect how each agent “pays” for its share of the outcome’s deviation. Agents with specialized roles may have high 
𝜆
𝑘
λ 
k
​
  but lower 
𝜇
𝑘
μ 
k
​
 , or vice versa, depending on system design.
5. Iterative Refinement Cycle
At each iteration 
𝑛
n:

Individual Agent Updates: Each 
𝐴
𝑘
A 
k
​
  draws on Knowledge Horizon 
𝐻
𝑘
H 
k
​
 , utility function 
𝑈
𝑘
U 
k
​
 , and prior iteration feedback.
Model Proposals: Each agent outputs 
𝑀
𝑛
+
1
(
𝑘
)
M 
n+1
(k)
​
  with a self-tagged confidence.
Aggregation: The aggregator computes 
𝑀
𝑛
+
1
M 
n+1
​
  via weighted summation using 
𝜆
𝑘
λ 
k
​
 .
Loss Partitioning: Overall system error 
𝐿
𝑡
𝑜
𝑡
𝑎
𝑙
L 
total
​
  is computed, partitioned among agents by 
𝜇
𝑘
μ 
k
​
 .
Feedback & Reintegration: The new “shared state” (aggregated model + losses + confidence signals) is fed back into each agent’s knowledge horizon for the next iteration.
6. Tracking Agent Identity & Data Provenance
Because data may come from disparate sources (e.g., different test types, historical logs, partial migrations from cloud services):

Self-Tagging for Data Ownership: Agents mark which inputs are “their own” vs. derived from external sources.
Persistence of Utility Functions: Each agent retains (or updates) its utility function 
𝑈
𝑘
U 
k
​
 , clarifying how and why it prioritizes certain solutions.
Economics & Negotiation: Agents can “negotiate” weighting in future iterations if certain utility functions lead to consistently beneficial outcomes or if some agents are systematically under-represented.
7. Broader Implications
Economics & AI: Modeling each agent as an economic entity with a utility function ties Giants to classical economic theories—supply vs. demand of relevant solutions, bidding for influence, etc.
Behavioral Diversity: Agents that adopt drastically different strategies preserve the system from converging prematurely to local minima.
Resilient Oversight: By tagging and partitioning losses, the system quickly identifies underperforming or malicious agents, supporting robust oversight.
8. Alignment with Giants Axioms
Differentiation & Reintegration: Multiple agents represent diverse perspectives, aggregated into a cohesive output.
Knowledge Integrity: Confidence tagging and partitioned losses ensure consistent accountability and reliability tracking.
Learning Path Influence: Iterations refine both individual agent models and the overall aggregator, guiding evolution toward improved synergy.
Mathematical Rigor: Each step—model proposals, weighted sums, loss partitioning—adheres to explicit formulas, preserving clarity.
Conclusion & Future Directions
Bean 7 moves Giants beyond single-agent introspection into multi-agent paradigms, blending economic concepts (utility, cost-sharing, negotiation) with the Giants core. By explicitly modeling each agent’s knowledge horizon, self-tagging, and utility function, we can scale intelligence refinement across complex, distributed systems. Future expansions may detail:

Agent Communication Protocols: How agents exchange partial results or intermediate confidences.
Advanced Loss Decomposition: Splitting loss into structural, epistemic, and procedural components per agent.
Adaptive Weighting Schemes: Mechanisms for adjusting 
𝜆
𝑘
λ 
k
​
  and 
𝜇
𝑘
μ 
k
​
  dynamically based on performance trends.
Here, test time becomes a dynamic market of ideas, where each agent’s proposal competes, merges, and refines in pursuit of robust, integrative knowledge—fulfilling Giants’ mission of continuous, mathematically rigorous intelligence evolution.
