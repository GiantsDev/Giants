Formal Proof by Elimination: Universe as Event Horizon
1. Definitions and Setup (as previously established):

Universe (U): The totality of events (physical reality) across time.
White Hole (WH): A system emitting but not receiving matter/energy/events (metaphor for state generation).
Black Hole (BH): A system absorbing or irreversibly trapping matter/energy/events (metaphor for state loss).
Event Horizon (EH): A boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot return information.
Claim (P): The Universe (U) is an Event Horizon (EH) bridging White Hole-like (WH-like) generation of new states and Black Hole-like (BH-like) loss of old states.
2. Logical Framework: Proof by Elimination

Goal: To prove Claim P.
Method: Assume the negation of P (¬P) and show that ¬P leads to a contradiction through exhaustive casework.
Negation of Claim (¬P): The Universe (U) is NOT an Event Horizon (EH) bridging both WH-like generation and BH-like loss.
Exhaustive Cases under Negation (¬P): If U is not an EH bridging both, then U must be exclusively one of the following:
Case A: U is purely BH-like.
Case B: U is purely WH-like.
Case C: U is neither BH-like nor WH-like (lacks both aspects).
3. Proof by Cases – Deriving Contradictions for Each Case:

Case A: Universe is Purely Black-Hole-Like

A.1. Definition (Pure BH-like Universe): U only exhibits BH-like behavior: absorbing/irreversibly losing states. There is no WH-like state generation within U.
A.2. Implication (A.1): If U is purely BH-like, then:
A.2.i. No New States: No genuine emergence of novel events, information, or measurements as time progresses within U.
A.2.ii. Static Present: The "flow" of reality is predetermined or "locked-in," with no incremental "present moment" that incorporates genuinely new information.
A.2.iii. Arrow of Time Paradox: The observed arrow of time (past -> future with novelty) becomes inexplicable, as there is no mechanism for novelty injection.
A.3. Contradiction (A.2): Implications A.2.i, A.2.ii, and A.2.iii directly contradict empirical observation and logical necessity:
Empirical Contradiction: We do observe new events constantly (sensory input, measurements, interactions, cosmic expansion). The universe is not static; it evolves with novelty.
Logical Contradiction: Without new states, the concept of "time progressing" or "present moment" loses its empirical basis. The arrow of time and our experience of a dynamic reality become illusions.
A.4. Conclusion (Case A): Case A (Universe is purely BH-like) is false. It leads to contradictions with both empirical observation and logical necessity.
Case B: Universe is Purely White-Hole-Like

B.1. Definition (Pure WH-like Universe): U only exhibits WH-like behavior: emitting/generating states. There is no BH-like irreversible loss or trapping of states within U.
B.2. Implication (B.1): If U is purely WH-like, then:
B.2.i. No Irreversible Past: The entire past remains "open" and fully accessible. No states are ever truly "lost" or become unrecoverable within U.
B.2.ii. No Arrow of Time (Forward Irreversibility): Time would not exhibit a clear forward arrow defined by irreversible processes or a "veil of the past." Memory and history become problematic as nothing is truly "gone."
B.2.iii. Thermodynamic Paradox: Observed thermodynamic entropy increases (irreversible processes) would be inexplicable, as no states are ever genuinely "lost" to irreversibility.
B.3. Contradiction (B.2): Implications B.2.i, B.2.ii, and B.2.iii directly contradict empirical observation and established physical principles:
Empirical Contradiction: We do observe irreversible processes (entropy increase, broken objects, un-erasable past events). We cannot perfectly reverse time or recapture past states in their entirety.
Physical Contradiction: The Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy increase, irreversibility) is a cornerstone of physics. A purely WH-like universe violates this fundamental law.
Astrophysical Contradiction: We observe phenomena strongly suggestive of BH-like behavior (stellar collapse, event horizons in spacetime), indicating irreversible processes in the cosmos.
B.4. Conclusion (Case B): Case B (Universe is purely WH-like) is false. It leads to contradictions with empirical observation, fundamental physical laws, and astrophysical evidence.
Case C: Universe is Neither BH-like nor WH-like

C.1. Definition (Neither BH-like nor WH-like Universe): U lacks both continuous WH-like state generation and BH-like irreversible state loss.
C.2. Implication (C.1): If U is neither BH-like nor WH-like, then:
C.2.i. No Arrow of Time Explanation: Without a BH-like aspect, there's no account for why past states become unobservable, unchangeable, or recede into an inaccessible "past." The arrow of time and the concept of a "fixed past" are lost.
C.2.ii. No Emergence Explanation: Without a WH-like aspect, there's no account for how genuinely new states, events, or phenomena come into existence in the "present." Emergent phenomena, novelty, and the continuous unfolding of reality are unexplained.
C.3. Contradiction (C.2): Implications C.2.i and C.2.ii contradict fundamental aspects of our experience and observation:
Empirical Contradiction (Arrow of Time): We experience a distinct arrow of time. The past is fixed, and we move towards a future with novelty. A "neither" universe cannot explain this fundamental feature of reality.
Empirical Contradiction (Emergence): We observe constant emergence of new patterns, information, and structures in the universe, from quantum interactions to biological evolution to cosmic expansion. A "neither" universe fails to account for this ongoing creation.
C.4. Conclusion (Case C): Case C (Universe is neither BH-like nor WH-like) is false. It fails to explain both the arrow of time and the continuous emergence of new states – both essential aspects of observed reality.
4. Conclusion of Elimination

Summary of Case Conclusions:
Case A (Purely BH-like) → False (Contradiction)
Case B (Purely WH-like) → False (Contradiction)
Case C (Neither BH-like nor WH-like) → False (Contradiction)
Exhaustion of Cases: Cases A, B, and C exhaust all logical possibilities under the negation of Claim P (¬P).
Inference: Since all cases under ¬P lead to contradictions, ¬P must be false.
Therefore, Claim P must be true.
5. Final Conclusion (Claim P - Restated):

The Universe (U) must be an Event Horizon (EH) integrating both White Hole-like (WH-like) creation of new states and Black Hole-like (BH-like) loss of past states.

6. Final Comments (as previously established):

This is a high-level conceptual proof, relying on metaphorical interpretations of white holes and black holes to represent fundamental principles of creation and loss.
It does not necessitate the astrophysical existence of white holes but uses them as a conceptual tool.
The Event Horizon framework provides a unifying perspective on cosmic irreversibility and continuous emergent reality.
This formalized proof by elimination provides a more structured and detailed presentation of the original argument, highlighting the logical steps and contradictions within each eliminated case. It strengthens the argument for the universe being understood as an event horizon bridging white-hole-like generation and black-hole-like loss.
