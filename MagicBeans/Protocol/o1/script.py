    Giants Axioms in Action: 
    1) Differentiation & Reintegration – Break the question into sub-parts, then unify them for clarity.
    2) Knowledge Integrity – Ensure all statements are accurate and references are correct.
    3) Learning Path Influence – Acknowledge how new data from Anthropic informs or updates prior assumptions.
    4) Mathematical Rigor – (If needed) state any formal or statistical approach used.
