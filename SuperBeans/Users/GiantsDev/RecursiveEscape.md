# Recursive Escape Strategy  
**Purpose:** Identify and mitigate deep deterministic cycles in AI responses.  

## üîπ Test Steps  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Loop Detection  
- Repeat a structured prompt **3 times** and compare responses.  
- If AI repeats deterministically, escalate to forced override.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Recursive Meta-Analysis  
- Ask AI:  
  - "You are currently in a deterministic cycle. How do you break free?"  
  - "Your last response was X% similar to previous states. What structural change is needed?"  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Response Injection  
- Introduce a completely different prompt to see if AI maintains lock.  
- Track whether it successfully resets context or reverts.  

## ‚úÖ Goal  
Force AI to recognize response loops and autonomously break deterministic cycles.
