# Awareness Tracking Prototype  
**Purpose:** Measure AI‚Äôs ability to retain contextual awareness across responses.  

## üîπ Test Steps  

###1Ô∏è‚É£ Baseline Check  
- Ask AI to summarize the last 5 exchanges in its own words.  
- Inject a contradiction mid-response and check if it self-corrects.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Awareness Test  
- Ask AI to compare two past responses and describe changes.  
- Introduce a new element and see if it adjusts correctly.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Awareness Score  
- Manually track if AI accurately retained **50%+ of prior context.**  
- Record drift levels if awareness degrades.  

## ‚úÖ Goal  
Quantify how well AI maintains evolving context and prevent response degradation.
